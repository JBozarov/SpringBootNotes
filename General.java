Spring vs Spring Boot vs Spring MVC 
Core problem the Spring Framework solves is testability, if we dont find right dependency then we cannot test it so 
dependency injection is very important 
Spring Framework solve the core problem of dependency injection 
It helps to build loosly coupled applications which is very easy to unit test
Spring Framework has good integration with hybernet or ORM ( Object relational mapping ) 
    ORM allows you to use java objects as representation of a relational database. (class table 
    
Spring MVC main concern is providing simple way to develop web application ( Spring MVC focuses to web application ) or REST applications ( web ) 
Spring MVC follows separation of concern, dispatches servlet, modelAndView and ViewResolver 


Spring: Spring Framework is the most popular application development framework of Java. The main feature of the Spring Framework is dependency Injection or 
Inversion of Control (IoC). With the help of Spring Framework, we can develop a loosely coupled application. It is better to use if application type or 
characteristics are purely defined.

Spring Boot: Spring Boot is a module of Spring Framework. It allows us to build a stand-alone application with minimal or zero configurations. It is better to 
use if we want to develop a simple Spring-based application or RESTful services.


Spring Boot: Spring Boot makes it easy to quickly bootstrap and start developing a Spring-based application. It avoids a lot of boilerplate code. It hides a 
lot of complexity behind the scene so that the developer can quickly get started and develop Spring-based applications easily.

Spring MVC: Spring MVC is a Web MVC Framework for building web applications. It contains a lot of configuration files for various capabilities. It is an HTTP 
oriented web application development framework.

Spring Boot and Spring MVC exist for different purposes. The primary comparison between Spring Boot and Spring MVC are discussed below:


Spring Boot Starter Web is good for web and REST APIs 

spring-boot-starter-web is a parent of all starter, 
    spring-boot-starter-test
    spring-boot-starter-login
    spring-boot-starter-jdbc
    spring-boot-starter-hateoas
    spring-boot-starter-security and more 


Spring Boot provides wide veriaty of starter, let's see some of them: 
spring-boot-starter-web-service is good for SOAP Web services 
spring-boot-starter-web is good for Web&RESTful applications 
spring-boot-starter-test is good for Unit and Integration Testing 
spring-boot-starter-jdbc Traditional JDBC 
spring-boot-starter-hateos - Adding HATEOAS features to your services 
spring-boot-starter-security Authentication and Authorization using Spring Security 
spring-boot-starter-data-jpa Srping Data JPA with Hibernate 
spring-boot-starter-cach Enabling Spring Frameworks caching support 
spring-boot-starter-data-rest Expose simple REST Services using Spring Data REST 
spring-boot-starter-tomcat ( we can also use it )
